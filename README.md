NOTE: The scaling system is designed to scale the board actively to your resolution; this feature is only tested on windows; if you are using MacOS or Linux, and is experiencing the board window behaving strangely or the layout being messed up, please contact me via github, or simply remove the Toolkit.getResolution() part and try again;
