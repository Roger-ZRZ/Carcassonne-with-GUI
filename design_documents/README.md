Readme: 

Note that all designs are subjected to change; 
I have written some code already for this design and most of the aspects are well defined and cohesive; 
most of the functions you see in the class diagram may have confusing naming or return values; for the purpose of this assignment, they are most likely will not be needed; all of the essential functions represented in the interaction diagrams should have pretty clear namings; 
if you are really interested, please refer to the comments in the source code for clarification;
